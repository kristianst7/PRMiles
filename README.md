# RunLog — GitHub Pages Ready

A private, browser-based running log with **Calendar + List + Stats**, zero backend, and localStorage persistence.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (e.g., `runlog`) and upload all files at the **repo root** (keep `index.html` at root).
2. Repo **Settings → Pages** → Build and deployment: *Deploy from a branch*, Branch `main`, Folder `/ (root)`.
3. Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/runlog/`.

## Local development
Just open `index.html` in your browser. Data is stored in localStorage.
